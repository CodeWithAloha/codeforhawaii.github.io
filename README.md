## installation

### vagrant

If you're on your development machine and want to use vagrant to isolate your
dependencies/workspace, we've included a Vagrantfile to help you get started.

Run the following command:

`vagrant up`

Once the vagrant instance is up, open your browser to:

`open http://127.0.0.1:4000`

### local ruby setup

- `gem install jekyll`
